EXECUTE R OR PYTHON SCRIPTS FROM TERMINAL:
python myscript.py ## need to ensure that right click > properties > permissions > executable is ticked, or use chmod
Rscript myscript.R ## same thing with the permissions
R CMD BATCH myscript.R ## executes the script and saves everything to myscript.R.Rout
R ## and then run: source('myscript.R')

EXECUTE SHELL SCRIPT FROM TERMINAL:
sh shscript1.sh ## execute shell script, which will be executed sequentially, 

## e.g. script, save the following text as shscript.sh and then execute using sh shscript.sh:
echo "Please enter your name"
read my_name
echo "Hello $my_name, how about a coffee?!"

ln OldFolder NewFolder ## create a hard replica of the content of a folder
ln -s newfile newfile_soft ## create a soft link (pointer) to a file (or folder)


FILES AND FOLDERS:
touch myfile1 myfile2 ## create two new empty text files
touch .myhiddenfile ## create a hidden file
cat > myfile3 ## create a new text file and fill it with contents, ctrl+d to close it
cat < myfile3 ## view the contents of the newly created file
cat myfile1 myfile3 > mergedfile ## to merge the contents of myfile1 and myfile3

sort myfile ## sort the lines in myfile aplhabetically
cut -d"-" -f 1,3 mytable ## extract the 1st and 3rd column of a hyphen separarated table from the file mytable
dd if=myfile of=myout conv=ucase ## convert the contents of myfile to upper case and save the output in new file myout

nano file_name ## edit a file in the terminal, ctrl+x and y to exit
mv myfile NewFolder ## move a file to NewFolder
mv oldfile newfile ## rename a file
cp myfile NewFolder ## copy a file to NewFolder
rm myfile ## remove a file
rm my* ## remove all files that start with "my"

pwd ## show the present working directory
ls ## list items in the present working directory
ls -l ## list items and show their permissions
ls -a ## list all items, including hidden files
ls -a -l ## combine the above

file * ## show details of all files and folder in the present working directory
wc myfile ## gives the number of lines, words and characters

wc -w myfile ## shows the number of words in myfile
wc -c myfile ## shows the number of characters in myfile

dir ## list items in the present working directory

PERMISSIONS FOR FILES AND FOLDERS:
## there are three categories of users of the operating system: owner, group, other users
## each user category can have any combination of read, write or execute permissions.
## unix permission codes:
read = 4
write = 2
execute = 1

umask ## look at last three digits to work out default file or folder permissions for the three categories of users
e.g. if last three digits show 022, unix subtracts it from 666 to give the file default permissions, so..
666 - 22 = 644 ## means default permissions for the owner 6=read+write, group 4=read, others 4=read
similar thing applies to folders except unix subtracts those three digits from 777, so..
777 - 22 = 755 ## means default permission for the owner 7=read+write+execute, group 5=read+write, others 5=read+write

chmod 777 myfile ## gives full permissions to all three categories of users (owner, group, other users)
chmod 777 MyFolder ## gives full permissions to all three categories of users (owner, group, other users)
